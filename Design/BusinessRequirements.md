# Business Requirements

#### BR1
* DocuMentor needs to allow employees to clock in and clock out while offline. 
  * This is a business requirement because the client clearly stated to us that their biggest need for the software is that it works offline. 
  Currently, their system only allows at-home caregivers to clock in and clock out while connected to the internet. 
  This leads to uncertainty in the number of hours employees work and payroll amounts. In order to eliminate these variables, the client would like the application to have offline capabilities.

#### BR2
* docuMentor needs to allow employees to fill out visit documents while offline.

#### BR3
* docuMentor should look like our online webapp so that the users are familiar with the simple design.

#### BR4
* docuMentor should only allow for caregiver functions and not administrator functions.
