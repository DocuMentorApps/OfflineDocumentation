## Topics Discussed
* William demoed our software:
  * He liked the simplicity of the flow and how everything looks.
* He was happy with our planned features for iteration 4.
  * Feature 1: Caregiver can clock into a visit online, then be able to clock out of that visit offline.
  * Feature 2: Caregiver can select multiple tasks performed for a visit, and have that information synced back once online.
  * Feature 3: Caregiver can select patient goals and have that information synced back once online.
  
## Things Clarified
* A user needs to clock in online once before they can use the offline mode so their data can be cached.
